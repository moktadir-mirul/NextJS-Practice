      "details": "The greatest financial disaster of the century, the Wall Street crash signalled the end of the roaring twenties in Sep 4 , 1929",
      "body": "Beginning on September 4, 1929 and lasting to mid-November, the Wall Street crash devastated the world economy. On Friday October 25, 1929, the Daily Mail ran a headline that read “Greatest Crash in Wall Street’s History.” It hauntingly depicted the massive extent of the damage, not to mention the historic nature of the crash itself. It came just one day after Black Thursday, which is generally considered the true start of the crash owing to the large amount of panic selling. With this headline, people knew the world was spiraling into chaos."

      "details": "In November of 1973, Young defeated white Police Commissioner John Nichols to become the first African American mayor of the city.",
      "body": "The 60s and early 70s were a turbulent time in American history, marked by protests and boycotts as the civil rights movement fought against racial discrimination. The city of Detroit was particularly polarized, which is why the mayorship of Coleman Young is so historic. The victory came despite Nichols’ attempts to generate fear about black crime in Detroit. On Wednesday November 7, 1973, the Detroit Free Press ran a headline reading “Young Elected City’s 1st Black Mayor,” complete with an image of Young flashing the peace sign. It’s a perfect representation of the civil rights movement’s positive impact."

      "body": "It also included some uncalled-for additions, like the subtitle “He was 42 and alone” and a photo with the insulting caption “Fat and forty...his overeating made him a tragic sight.” But the headline itself both informs, and pays respect to the legendary singer, who’d been dubbed the King of Rock and Roll. And while the subtitle was unnecessarily blunt, it was true. Elvis did indeed die alone, passing away from heart disease in his bathroom."
